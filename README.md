## About the Project ##

Unfortunately, due to the Unity Asset Store Terms of Agreement, redistribution of assets is strictly prohibited. Therefore, this repository contains only the source code of the project.

**This project can NOT be classified as Free or Open Software, since compilation and execution is impossible without the assets. However you are free to view, copy and modify the source code.**

This project is currently over development by Leonardo Tagliaro ([Github](https://github.com/leotgo), [itch.io](https://leotgo.itch.io)), and is part of his dissertation for the degree of Bachelor in Computer Science.
